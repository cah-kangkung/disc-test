# Introduction

This once originaly will become my personal 'modular' type kinda **boiler plate** for future project. I use Codeigniter as the backend and bootstrap for some
default styling. It's included with:
1. User_auth model and controller, fully implement with email verification and forgot passsword functionality.
2. Basic payment business process, both for user and admin side.
3. HTML to PDF converter. I use TCPDF just because its simple yet has a lot of features. 

This three business process are the most requested and time consuming things my clients always ask. So this will act as a nice base for future developement.
Aside from that purpose. This is also act as my exercise to use VCS like GIT for all of my projects, no matter if its solo or team project. And of course to
hone my skill in backend programming.

# Originality and Copyright

A lot of codes from `User_auth` model and controller are taken from a channel on youtube called **Web Programming UNPAS**. Everything else is build on top of reading 
a lot of documentations.
